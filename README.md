# The Java brujo-json library
This Java [JSON](https://json.org) library is a full-featured, production-ready library for parsing, querying, building, and manipulating JSON data in Java. It is really fast, small, and has no dependencies.
## Why use this library?
There are many JSON Java libraries available, so why choose this one? Here are some of the reasons:
- **full-featured**. The library can parse, query, build, and manipulate JSON data in any way you need.
- **production-ready**. The library has been tested in a large project and is ready to be used in production.
- **extremely fast**. The library can parse a 25 MB JSON file in 0.5 seconds.
- **surprisingly small**. The library is only few hundreds lines of code.
- **zero dependencies**. The library does not depend on any other libraries.
## Who is this library for?
This library is for anyone who wants to use a JSON library that does exactly what it is claimed to do. It is ideal for people who are learning about JSON or who want to customize the library to their own needs.
## Limits
It does not support SAX style parsing. However, it will be added in the future.
## Requirements
To compile the code Java 11+ is required.
