# The Java JSON library
## Why another JSON Java library?
Because:<br>
1. It is full featured ( parse, query, build, manipulate)
2. It is production ready and alredy tested in a large project
3. It is really fast (0.5 seconds to parse 25 MB of JSON file)
4. It is really small
5. It has no dependency. 
## Who is addressed to?
1. Anyone who wants to use a library that do exctly what is claimed to
2. It is ideal to people who wants to learn
3. It is ideal for customization becose the code is really small and stright forward
## Limits
No SAX style parser (but it will be developed in future).<br>
No other functions than JSON e.g. no XML convertion.
